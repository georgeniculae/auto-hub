Swift Wheels Hub

Swift Wheels Hub is a Java-based application designed to manage booking and invoicing for a car rental service. The project leverages Spring Boot for building the application, Maven for dependency management, and SQL for database interactions.  
Features
Booking Management
Booking Creation: Allows users to create new bookings for car reservations, specifying details such as car type, rental period, and customer information.
Booking Updates: Supports updating existing bookings with new details, such as changes in rental period or car type.
Booking Mapping: Converts booking entities to DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and vice versa for seamless data transfer between different layers of the application.
Messaging
Kafka Integration: Utilizes Kafka for sending booking update messages asynchronously to ensure real-time communication and updates.
Error Handling: Implements robust error handling and logging for message sending operations to ensure reliability and traceability.
Testing Utilities
Test Data Management: Provides utilities for loading test data from JSON files, making it easier to set up and run tests with consistent data.
Assertions: Includes custom assertion utilities for validating test results, ensuring that the application behaves as expected under various conditions.
Exception Handling
Custom Exceptions: Defines custom exceptions for handling specific error scenarios within the application, providing more meaningful error messages and improving debugging.
